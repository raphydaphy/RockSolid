## Getting Started

A guide to help you progress with RockSolid.

### After Vanilla

Almost all the content in RockSolid comes in after you already have a Smelter, Separator and at least a Copper Pickaxe from the base game. You will need your Copper Pickaxe to obtain Tin Ore, which is the first available resource from the mod.

Tin Ore can be processed in a Separator to produce Tin Clusters, much like the vanilla Copper Ore. You must then smelt the clusters to obtain Tin Ingots. These are used to construct an Alloy Smelter, which is the first item you should work towards obtaining.

### Bronze Age

With your new Alloy Smelter, you are now able to produce Bronze Ingots. Simply place Tin Ingots in the first slot of your Alloy Smelter, and Copper Ingots in the second. Add coal to the fuel slot and wait a little for the metal to fuse together. The output slot will contain four Bronze Ingots per every three Copper and one Tin.

Bronze is used to craft many different machines and tools later in the game, but for now all you will need is a Bronze Pickaxe. You can use this to obtain Iron Ore, which can then be processed the same way that Copper and Tin are. Collect a couple Iron Ingots to progress forwards.

### Steel Production

Now that you have access to Iron Ingots, you can construct a Blast Furnace using many of your collected supplies. This machine is used to convert Coal into a refined mixture infused with extra carbon - Coal Coke. It has other uses later on but for now this is all you will need it for.

Put Coal into your Blast Furnace and let it run for a couple minutes. It is very slow, but dosen't require any fuel to run, making it easier to keep multiple Blast Furnaces refining Coke at once. You will need a lot of Coal Coke later on, and it can be used as a fuel with twice the efficiency of regular Coal, so it won't hurt to get some extra.

Once you have a supply of Coal Coke, use the Alloy Smelter you made earlier and combine Iron Ingots with your Coal Coke. Once it has successfully combined the two items you will recieve a single Steel Ingot. This strong, valuable metal has many important uses throughout the game.

### Industrial Revolution

With Steel readily avalable to you now, you can begin to produce Electricity. You will need to start by compressing your steel into Steel Construction Blocks, using your Construction Table. These Construction Blocks are the basis of most advanced machines in the game, and you will need to use them to create various structures.

To get some basic infrastructure set up, you will need a Solid-Fueled Boiler, a Turbine and a Battery. You can go without the battery at the start but it is very important to prevent wasting excess power. You will also need a Bucket in order to carry some water to your Boiler before you have access to pumps to automate the process.

In order to operate your Boiler, you will need a water source. If you haven't already found water in your world, go looking for some. It's blue and spawns in pools on the surface as well as in caves. For now, right-click it with your bucket to collect a liter of water at a time. You can then right-click the filled bucket onto a boiler in the world to add the water to the internal storage.

Solid-Fueled Boilers require a solid fuel and water. They operate by heating the water using the fuel to produce steam. You will need Gas Conduits to move the steam out of the Boiler. Construct some Gas, Energy and Fluid conduits as you will need them all soon. You can then also put some Coal, Coal Coke, or any other fuel into the Boiler to begin producing Steam.

In order to use Conduits, you will need a wrench. Construct one and right-click a conduit that you have placed in the world to configure it. You can set the priority and operation mode on all four sides of the conduit simply by selecting the side in the GUI and changing the settings. Read the tooltips for more information on what each operation mode does (Input, Output and Disabled). Setup your Boiler, Gas Conduits and Turbine similar to the picture below, ensuring that the gas is being extracted from the boiler and pumped into the turbine.
